# Privacy Policy

*Last updated: February 2026*

This Privacy Policy applies to the Android application **Glitch Please!** (package name: `com.michaljenco.glitchplease`), developed by Michal Jenčo.

## No Data Collection

Glitch Please! does not collect, store, transmit, or share any personal data or usage information. The app has no analytics, no crash reporting, no advertising SDK, and no network connectivity of any kind.

## How the App Works

All image and video processing happens entirely on your device. Images you load into the app are processed locally and never leave your device. The app requires no internet connection and requests no network permissions.

## Permissions

The app requests only the permissions necessary to read and save media:

- **Read media (photos/videos)** — to load images you want to edit.
- **Write media** — to save processed images and videos to your gallery.

No other permissions are requested or used.

## Third Parties

No data is shared with third parties. The app contains no third-party SDKs that collect data.

## Children's Privacy

The app does not collect any data from any user, including children under the age of 13.

## Changes to This Policy

If the app ever changes in a way that affects privacy, this policy will be updated and the "Last updated" date above will reflect that change.
